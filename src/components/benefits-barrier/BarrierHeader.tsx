        The opportunity in employee benefits has never been greater. More than 80% of small and
        medium-sized businesses remain underserved in the benefits market, creating a massive
        whitespace for advisors who can deliver modern solutions. When you add benefits to your client
        relationships, retention rates soar. Clients who purchase multiple lines of coverage stay
        with their advisors longer, refer more business, and build deeper trust over time.
